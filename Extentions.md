# Extentions:

#1. Pathfinding and Obstacles:

	•	Obstacles: Introduce geographical features or man-made structures (e.g., rivers, mountains, buildings, roads) that limit or influence the movement of individuals.
	•	Pathfinding Algorithms: Implement algorithms like A (A-star)* or Dijkstra’s Algorithm to allow individuals to intelligently navigate around obstacles and find the most efficient path to a safe zone.
	•	Barriers and Roads: Add natural or artificial barriers, and include designated pathways or roads where movement is easier or faster.

#2. Social Interactions and Collective Behavior:

	•	Group Dynamics: Individuals could move in groups instead of independently, reflecting real-world behavior where families or communities might stick together.
	•	Crowd Influence: Incorporate flocking behavior (like Boids) where individuals react to the positions of their neighbors, causing them to follow, align with, or avoid other individuals.
	•	Leader-Follower Models: Designate “leaders” that influence the movement of nearby individuals, simulating herd-like or group-based behavior where certain individuals lead others.

#3. Stress or Panic Modeling:

	•	Panic Factors: In high-stress situations like crises, individuals may make irrational or suboptimal decisions. You can introduce panic levels that influence their speed and decision-making abilities.
	•	Randomness in Behavior: Vary the movement strategies by introducing a probability of making bad decisions or taking longer routes due to stress or panic.
	•	Variable Speeds: During crisis situations, some individuals may panic and move faster, while others may freeze or slow down. You could assign different speeds based on stress levels.

#4. Time-Varying Events:

	•	Dynamic Crisis Zones: Crisis zones (such as fire, flood, or conflict areas) could expand or contract over time, forcing individuals to continuously adjust their paths.
	•	New Safe Zones: Introduce new safe zones as the simulation progresses, reflecting real-world scenarios where new shelters or evacuation routes become available.
	•	Multiple Crises: Add more than one type of crisis (e.g., a fire and a flood) that spread differently and interact with one another. Each crisis might affect individuals differently (e.g., fire blocks some paths, while floods make certain areas unreachable).

#5. Heterogeneous Individuals:

	•	Different Capabilities: Not all individuals should behave the same way. Introduce differences in individual attributes like:
	•	Speed: Some individuals might move faster or slower.
	•	Age: Older individuals or children might move slower and prefer shorter paths.
	•	Health: Injured or less healthy individuals might have limited mobility.
	•	Preferences: Some individuals might prefer certain safe zones over others based on proximity, group affiliation, or previous knowledge.

#6. Terrain and Environment Influences:

	•	Terrain Impact: Different terrains (e.g., hills, forests, urban areas) can affect movement speed and direction. Incorporate different movement penalties or boosts depending on the terrain.
	•	Weather Conditions: Realistic weather (rain, snow, wind) can slow down individuals or make certain paths more dangerous or impassable.
	•	Lighting: Introduce day/night cycles, where movement becomes more difficult in low visibility conditions.

#7. External Agents and Interventions:

	•	External Helpers (Rescue Teams): Introduce rescue teams that actively seek out individuals and guide them to safety. These agents could move toward individuals or create temporary safe zones.
	•	Law Enforcement/Military Agents: In conflict zones, the presence of armed forces or police could influence movement (e.g., some individuals may flee from certain areas due to danger).
	•	Crowd Density Effects: Simulate the effect of overcrowding in certain areas, where movement becomes slower or blocked if too many individuals are present in the same space.

#8. Resource Limitations and Priorities:

	•	Limited Safe Zone Capacity: Safe zones could have a limited capacity, forcing some individuals to look for alternative locations once they become full.
	•	Resource Scarcity: Introduce food, water, and shelter as needs. Individuals could prioritize movement toward safe zones that provide these resources.
	•	Multiple Objectives: Individuals could have other priorities (e.g., seeking family members or gathering possessions) before heading to safe zones.

#9. Communication and Awareness:

	•	Limited Information: Some individuals may have incomplete or inaccurate information about the locations of crisis zones and safe zones. They might rely on rumors or follow others, leading to suboptimal decisions.
	•	Signal Mechanisms: Safe zones or rescue teams could broadcast signals to guide individuals to safety. Some individuals might be drawn toward these signals.
	•	Cellular or Radio Networks: Introduce communication breakdowns or technologies to simulate limited or unreliable communication in the crisis.

#10. Simulation of Real Geographical Data:

	•	Real-World Data: Use real maps with detailed features such as roads, rivers, and elevation.
	•	Population Density: Populate the map with real population density distributions, making some areas more crowded than others.
	•	Safe Zone Locations: Base the safe zone locations on real shelters or evacuation points.

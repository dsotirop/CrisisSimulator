# CrisisSimulator

This software module simulates the movement of individuals during a crisis scenario, such as a natural disaster or conflict, with the goal of guiding them toward predefined safe zones. The module uses a grid-based environment where individuals feel attractive forces toward the closest safe zone and repulsive forces from crisis zones. The simulation is driven by a combination of behavioral models and random movement, making the scenario dynamic and responsive. Zones (both crisis and safe) are randomly generated, and individuals are initialized within the boundaries of crisis zones, gradually moving based on the forces they experience. The module supports real-world geographical data by incorporating GeoPandas for map display, and uses Pygame for visualizing the simulation. Additionally, individualsâ€™ positions are tracked, and the simulation stops once movement becomes infinitesimal, enhancing efficiency. A key feature of this module is its ability to save the simulation as a GIF, capturing all frames to visualize the movement of individuals over time.
